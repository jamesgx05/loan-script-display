<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you.  Just to advise at this stage we need to carry out a soft credit search, it won’t affect your credit score. It’s just to check eligibility.<br>
<br>
If you’re happy to proceed with the loan today, then a hard credit check may be done later down the line, hard checks could affect your credit score, BUT for now we’re just doing a soft credit check, are you happy for me to submit that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Whilst we’re waiting for a decision, just some advice for you, I’d avoid making too many applications for credit cards, store cards, catalogues and loans, but if you want further information go to moneyhelper.org.uk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Submit EVOLUTION MONEY application</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">EVOLUTION MONEY</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><br>
Great news, you’ve passed the initial credit assessment for the loan with a lender called Evolution Money, they are a reputable lender, authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">You said at the start of the call you wanted a loan of </span><span class="s5">£XXXX,</span><span class="s2"> Evolutions loans start at £5,000, and you have been pre-approved up to </span><span class="s5">£XXXX </span><span class="s2">How much shall I get you a quote on?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">And over how many years?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">IMPORTANT TO FIND A NEED FOR A LOAN OVER £5,000</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">So that you know, Evolution can change the loan term and loan value based on any additional checks they carry out. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The monthly payment on </span><span class="s5">£XXXX</span><span class="s2"> over a term of </span><span class="s5">XXX</span><span class="s2"> is </span><span class="s5">£XXX</span><span class="s2"> per month, how does that sound?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The next step is to speak with a qualified adviser, who can run through the rates and features of the loan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I know I’ve taken a few minutes of your time today, but this next part is very important, so please listen carefully, is that ok?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">You’ve passed the initial credit check with Evolution, so if you’ve missed any payments or have any bad credit, they already know this, so don’t worry.  However the adviser will go through your credit report with you, it’s completely normal and doesn’t take that long.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The whole process to get your funds, can take around 3-5 working days. But it will really depend on you and how quickly you can answer the questions and send any proofs they may need.  Is that, ok?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Please hold the line while I put you through, it can take a few minutes to connect you, but we will be as fast as we can.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s7">LOANS WAREHOUSE</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><br>
OK, great news you’ve been passed the initial assessment for the loan with our partners called Loans Warehouse, they’re a very reputable company who are also authorized and regulated by the financial conduct authority and have a 5-star rating. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><br>
Their loans start at £10,000. I appreciate that’s maybe slightly more than what you were originally looking for, but with the additional amount you can use the funds for other purposes if you wish and could pay off some high interest debt, maybe you can treat yourself to a holiday, or a new car, or maybe some home improvements.  The qualified adviser can go through the payments, terms and rates with you, so is £10,000, ok?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Ok, please hold the line while I put you through, it can take a few minutes sometimes to connect you, but we will be as fast as we can.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s7">QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIONS</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7">I’ve sorted the loan / I've got the loan already / I don’t need the loan anymore /</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Ok, no problem, the reason I’ve called is to make sure you’ve got the best loan from the website. We've got extra deals on the phone with loans from £5,000 that you might not see online, and the rates and monthly payments can be lower. Shall I take a few details and see what we can do, it won’t take long to get a decision, what was the loan for again?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7">I don’t have time / Can you call me back</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">OK no problem, it will only take a few minutes to get a decision, I’ll try and be as quick as I can and if you’re approved, we can always arrange a call back to speak with an adviser to finalize everything, what was the loan for again?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7">What's your rate? / How much is the monthly payment</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our APR range is quite vast as it depends on some of your personal information to determine what rate we can do, the lowest rate we do is 6% but I would rather complete an application which takes a few minutes and get you a decision and go from there, what was the loan for again?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s7"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7">I don’t want secured / Is this a secured loan</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I understand your concerns, a secured loan can sound more serious than it really is, if you took out a personal loan and couldn’t afford to keep up the repayments, the reality is the personal loan lender may apply a charge to your property anyway. So providing you keep up to date with your payments and importantly you keep in touch with the lender when you experience any issues, you shouldn’t have any problems at all,  and secured loans are usually easier to obtain, and the rates and payments are usually lower than a personal loan, shall I get you a quote so you can at least see the costs?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s7"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s7">How long is this going to take</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s7"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The adviser will need to run through your income and expenditure, along with your credit report, don't worry this is completely normal and it will go quickly if you have a rough idea of the answers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The first call with the qualified adviser is the most important part of the process and once you have done that, it’s straightforward.  I would try and get it over and done with now, so you can get your full quote and get the loan completed as soon as possible, what was the loan for again?</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, we're unable to offer secured loans in your current situation. However, I would recommend reaching out to your Debt Management Plan company or Insolvency Practitioner (IP) for advice on the best next steps. They can help guide you based on your specific financial situation.</span></p>
